# Simple Keras Tutorial

This repository presents a simple example of a 2D CNN use for classification. We choose to work with the Keras framework, as it is the most one of the most accessible ones. We propose to use `cifar10` as a dataset. However, do not hesitate to use your own dataset instead.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
	```sh
	git@github.com:nperraud/keras_tutorial.git
	cd keras_tutorial
	```
2. Install the requirements (highly recommended in a virtual environnement)
	```
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
3. Launch jupyter
	```
	jupyter lab
	```

## The tutorial

Read the instructions in the notebook `keras_exercise.ipynb`. You can find a solution in `keras_solution.ipynb`.
